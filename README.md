# Codeforces Solutions

This repository contains my **Codeforces** solutions written in mainly **C++** and some **Python**.
Problems are organized by **rating**, **mock contests**, **real contests**, and **practice structure**.

---

## Current Status

* **Codeforces rating:** Unrated
* **First contest:** *Welcome 2026* (Jan 7th 9:35-12:35)
* **Short-term goal:** Reach **1200** after my first few contests
* **Long-term goal:** Reach **1500** through consistent practice
* **Focus:** Solving problems getting to a point were DSA is important not just implementation

I’m currently **taking theory slowly** and prioritizing practice:

* Reading *Introduction to Competitive Programming*
* Progress: **41 / 279 pages**
* Finished 17 problems with my highest rating solved is 1300

## gym/ (Practice by Rating)

Practice problems grouped by Codeforces difficulty rating:

* r0800
* r0900
* r1000
* r1100
* r1200
* r1300

### File Naming Convention

```
<problemID>_<problem_name>.<extension>
```

Example:

* `263A_Beautiful_Matrix.cpp`
* `263A_Beautiful_Matrix.py`

---

## MockComp/

Contains solutions from mock contests, organized by contest and division.

---

## templates/

Starter templates used for contests and practice:

* Fast I/O
* Common includes
* Python boilerplate

---

## How to Run

### C++

```bash
g++ file.cpp -o run
./run
```

### Python

```bash
python3 file.py
```

---

## Purpose

* Build strong problem-solving intuition
* Improve rating through lots of practice
* Learn some theory gradually while coding regularly

Progress will never be this fast, so it's important to use it
